	<P><h3>Buttons</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>(C)lear: clears the grid of any live cells.
		<li>(P)opulate: randomly populates a third of the grid with live cells.  
		<li>Run (1) cycle: iterates through the 'game' 1 full cycle.
		<li>(R)un continuous : lets the game run repeatedly through the cycles until either all live cells die or you stop the game.
		<li>Stop: stops the continuous mode (only appears when continuous is selected).
	</ul></P>
	<p>* Note: short-cut keys for the buttoms are contained within brackets (e.g. 'c' will clear the grid)</BR>
	* You can also click any of the cells to change their state.</p>
	
	<P>I've always known <i>just enough</i> javascript to get through what I needed and for some reason always pushed off learning it to focus on 'backend' langages.  Recently however, I decided to try out an online course and with several of the segments under my belt, thought I'd take a crack at writting the game of life entirely in JS.  This represents what I'll call my alpha version.  Who knows if I'll ever revisit it again but I thought it was a decent start.</P>

		<P>I've only tried this on whatever version of Chrome is currently on my PC so your mileage may vary.</p>
		<P>Feel free to use the code for whatever purpose suites you.  This was a learning excercise for me so if it helps you do the same, good luck!</p>
